--- 		DIconLayout is what replaced [DPanelList](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DPanelList) in Garry's Mod 13.
--- 		DPanelList still exists in GMod but is deprecated and does not support the new GWEN skin.
---
--- 		[DIconLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DIconLayout) is used to make a list of panels.
--- 		Unlike DPanelList, DIconLayout does not automatically add a scroll bar - the example below shows you how you can do this.
