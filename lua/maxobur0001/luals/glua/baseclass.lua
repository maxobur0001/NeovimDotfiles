---@meta

--- The baseclass library. Used to lookup a field from a metatable.
baseclass = {}

---[SHARED AND MENU] Gets the base class of an an object.
---
--- 	This is used not just by entities, but also by widgets, panels, drive modes, weapons and gamemodes (with "gamemode_" prefix).
---
--- 	The keyword **DEFINE_BASECLASS** translates into a call to this function. In the engine, it is replaced with:
---
--- 	```lua
--- 	local BaseClass = baseclass.Get
--- 	```
---
--- 	**NOTE**: You should prefer using this instead of `self.BaseClass` to avoid infinite recursion.
---
--- 	For more information, including usage examples, see the [BaseClasses](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/BaseClasses) reference page.
