---
--- A generic vertical scrollbar, used in [DScrollPanel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DScrollPanel). See the horizontal alternative [here](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DHScrollBar).
---
--- The scrollbar notably contains `DVScrollBar.btnUp`, `DVScrollBar.btnDown`, and `DVScrollBar.btnGrip` which are the up button, down button, and grip respectively. Editing the paint functions of these allows custom scrollbar styling (See [DScrollPanel:GetVBar](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DScrollPanel:GetVBar) for an example), although it is a better idea to use [Derma Skins](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Derma_Skin_Creation).
