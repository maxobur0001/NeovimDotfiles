--- 		Renderable mesh object, can be used to create models on the fly.
--- 		The only way to create your own IMesh object is to call [Global.Mesh](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Mesh).
---
--- 		**NOTE**: IMeshes only respond to one projected texture.
--- 			See the [render.RenderFlashlights](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.RenderFlashlights) function and example that solves this problem.

---@class IMesh
local IMesh = {}

---[CLIENT] Builds the mesh from a table mesh vertexes.
---
--- When modifying a previously built mesh, your new mesh must match the vertex count!
---
--- See [Global.Mesh](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Mesh) and [util.GetModelMeshes](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.GetModelMeshes) for examples.
---
--- **WARNING**: [IMesh](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/IMesh) appears to have a limit of 65535 vertices. You should split your mesh into multiple meshes when above this limit.
---
--- Exceeding the limit may lead to undefined rendering behavior.

---[CLIENT] Deletes the mesh and frees the memory used by it.
