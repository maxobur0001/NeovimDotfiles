--- 		[DImage](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage) is an advanced, more robust version of the [Material](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Material) panel.
---
--- 		See [DImageButton](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImageButton) for a click-able version of this panel.

---[CLIENT AND MENU] **INTERNAL**: This is used internally - although you're able to use it you probably shouldn't.
---
--- Actually loads the [IMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/IMaterial) to render it. Called from [DImage:LoadMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage:LoadMaterial).

---
--- "Fixes" the current material of the [DImage](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage) if it has VertexLit shader by creating a new one with the same name and a prefix of "_DImage" and automatically calling [DImage:SetMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage:SetMaterial) with the new material.
---
--- This fixes the problem where using materials using shaders that expect lighting information causing "weird" flickering when displayed in 2D/Unlit environment.

function DImage:LoadMaterial() end

---[CLIENT AND MENU] Paints a ghost copy of the DImage panel at the given position and dimensions. This function overrides [Panel:PaintAt](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:PaintAt).

---[CLIENT AND MENU] Sets the image to load into the frame. If the first image can't be loaded and `strBackup` is set, that image will be loaded instead.
---
--- This eventually calls [DImage:SetMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage:SetMaterial).
---

function DImage:SetImageColor(col) end

---[CLIENT AND MENU] Sets whether the [DImage](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage) should keep the aspect ratio of its image when being resized.
---
--- Note that this will not try to fit the image inside the button, but instead it will fill the button with the image.

---[CLIENT AND MENU] Similar to [DImage:SetImage](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage:SetImage), but will only do the expensive part of actually loading the textures/material if the material is about to be rendered/viewed.
---
--- Useful for cases like [DIconBrowser](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DIconBrowser), where there are hundreds of small icons in 1 panel in a list that do not need all to be loaded at the same time.
